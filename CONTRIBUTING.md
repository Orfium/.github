# FRONTEND

## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE

You can download the project and run it locally based on the description that is usually placed at README.md.

Make any required changes there and commit your changes. You can find how we commit [here](https://orfium.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FE/pages/927039566/Commits+-+How+we+contribute)

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.  
- Fill in the "Ready for review" template so that we can review your PR. This template helps reviewers understand your changes as well as the purpose of your pull request.Â   
- Don't forget to link any JIRA ticket on the PR header - if you are solving one.  
Once you submit your PR, a member will review it. We may ask questions or request additional information.  
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged. PR rules of the team can be found [here](https://orfium.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FE/pages/924254280/Pull+Requests)

If you are NOT part of the FE team as we need to keep align with all the changes that happens we will be responsible for the PR merge. 
If you are the owner and part of the FE team you are allowed to merge your PR when it gets the approvals neccessary.

### Your PR is merged!
